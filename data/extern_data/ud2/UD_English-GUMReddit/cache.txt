The money that is printed is **FEDERAL RESERVE** (thanks for the corrections) notes--it\'s *technically* a debt that the Reserve owes the bearer of the note (but printing money does not technically increase the debt supply--the role of money has changed since fiat currency).  \n \nWhen you print more money, you are devaluing the rest of the currency that is already in circulation.  This means that if the govt decided to print $100,000,000,000,000,000 (1 quadrillion dollars) in the span of a week, the value of the dollar would probably crash pretty hard (probably...).  This is related because people use money to buy US debt--we\'re loaning the US govt the very money it prints.  The only reason that this results in anything favorable is because people all over the world value USD and that paper currency represents potential labor, new assets, etc.\n\nIf you own a baseball card of Sammy Sosa, there is a chance it could be worth a lot of money.  Now imagine if the card company just mails a Sammy Sosa card to every family in America.  Your Sammy Sosa card isn\'t worth anything anymore because there are so many of them and everyone has it now.  Now imagine if they mailed another 5 to everyone--the value crashes even harder because there are SO many of them now.\n\nThat\'s the same idea with money. You can\'t keep printing more money or else the value of it will deteriorate.  But the gov\'t keeps issuing more debt and we still look at $20 like it\'s $20, right?  Eventually, there could come a time when we look at a $20 bill and it means nothing to us.  \n\nThis is what happened in Zimbabwe where a billion dollar transaction might happen for a loaf of bread.  They printed so much money (without proper secure backing by the gov\'t) that it just became worthless.  So they started to just increase the numbers on their currency so you can actually pay for something.\n\nBecause the gov\'t theoretically owes its population money, they issue paper as a certificate of this.  You might not have physically went to the bank and traded something in return for paper but you did something that warranted the earning of that dollar.  If you work for a company, they pay you that money because it has value and you can buy things with it.  \n\nThe only reason it has value is because the US gov\'t says it does.  You can pay gov\'t-related fees and bills with the money they issue and because the gov\'t is well-secured, people accept it.  If our gov\'t was unstable, no one would trust the dollars they slept under for warmth because the gov\'t could just come out and say, \'Sorry we\'re not paying you guys back\'.\n\nWell what would they be paying back?  To whom are they paying back to?  \n\nIt used to be gold.  But as we grew as a planet, we ran out of gold to back every dollar with and it just became a nightmare to handle.  Enter, fiat currency, a piece of paper that means nothing except what the gov\'t says it means.\n\nPeople used to go to banks with gold and receive \'money\' for it.  The banks would literally hold their gold and give them an certificate that says they own a claim of gold in their vaults.  If ANYONE brought that certificate to the bank, they could expect to receive gold for it.  That\'s what gave it value.  \n\nYou could say you want that farmer\'s potatoes and he can go get $1 of gold from the bankers at his convenience or he could hold onto it and use it just like the person did before him--\'trade\' it for something else like new shoes.  Why?  Because everyone liked gold and everyone believed gold had value.\n\nEventually, this took off and people stopped trading for things and we developed currency with quantitative values that allowed for easy exchanges to take place.  \n\nSo you might think, \'Well, now that there isn\'t gold behind my dollar, how is it worth anything even if the gov\'t say it is?  They won\'t give me anything in return for it".\n\nThe same thing applies to gold.  No one wants gold unless other people want gold.  If you can\'t reasonably trade your gold for something else, then what value does it have?  (Someone did point out you can shave gold flakes into your water and drink it, like some companies have chosen to do, but that\'s on you)\n\nAs long as people continue to value dollars, it doesn\'t matter what it\'s worth, sans some certain supply and demand laws.  So gold is no different in that regard.  The ONE difference between paper currency and gold is that $100,000 in cash weighs a lot less than $100,000 in gold and is a lot easier to hide too.\n\nEDIT:  I made some slight revisions to correct errors and to try and relate things better to the main topic at hand.  Sorry, I kinda started rambling.  I have also posted below in response to u/penny_eater to correct my errors and explain them in a little bit further detail but it kinda strays away from ELI5 territory.\n\nThis kinda seems all over the place but it should be good starter information for someone trying to understand debt markets and macroeconomics, in general.  Monetary supply and debt are pretty hand-in-hand, even if they\'re not exactly the same thing.\n\nLarger and more complex economies warranted the development of fiat currency which ultimately changed the role of currency, in general.  It no longer represents a claim, per se, but it represents value because the gov\'t says it has value and will accept it for gov\'t related transactions and business with foreign entities.  \n\nAlso, don\'t get me started on the petrodollar.\n\n-------------------\n\n**Sorry I wanted to just double clarify.  My main answer to the question "Who does the US Gov\'t borrow from?" was "It\'s own people".  My money talk (everything after that first sentence) was just to lead into the topic of increasing debt, economics, and the value of this debt in the coming future.  **\n\nI thought "It\'s own people" would be a sufficient answer to that but started to get into the reasons why that is starting to look like a bad idea especially in our current economic environment.', 'id': 'dmwwqlt', 'parent_id': 't3_6zm74h', 'retrieved_on': 1506719765, 'author_flair_text': None, 'subreddit': 'explainlikeimfive', 'created_utc': 1505242312, 'link_id': 't3_6zm74h', 'name': None, 'distinguished': None, 'score_hidden': None, 'gilded': 0, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'archived': None}]

2q6qnv	[{'id':'2q6qnv','selftext':'Polygraph and other deception detection devices. First, this is not me telling you how to beat polygraph (poly.) When taking the test, it is common for the examiner to ask if you have researched how to pass the poly deceptively. So, if you read this, understand that I am not going to tell you how to beat the test. It is also worth mentioning that doing something like that is, generally, a bad idea. Second, let’s just get something out of the way. A polygraph is not admissible in criminal court, and for good reason. It is not going to give us specific information. There have been people who have lied and not shown deception. There are some people who showed deception, who were not necessarily lying. Having said that, it is still a great tool for verifying truthfulness, and I’m a big fan of using it in this kind of a process. Hopefully I can explain to you why that happens here. All of these Deception Detection Devices (DDD) work on a basic principal. Your body has involuntary and automatic responses to lying. Basically, you are afraid of getting caught. No matter how little, there is still a bit of everyone that hopes we don’t get caught. The fact that you’re hooked up to the machine really tends to amplify this. These machines are actually fear detectors. They measure your body’s reaction to fear, like your heart rate increasing or changing just to name one. So how does a truthful person show deception? Let me show you. 20 years ago, an applicant…let’s call him Joe…was out with friends at a bar. While there he was approached by a prostitute who offered him her services. Joe, being the fine and upstanding individual he is, turned her down. On his background paperwork he indicated that he had never paid anyone for sex and he has never sought to pay anyone for sex…both are true. However, Joe has a flash of a thought from that night when the examiner asks him if he has paid for sex. His body, automatically, is afraid that he should have said something. The machine will pick that reaction up. The reason this isn\'t scientific is because just because it shows deception on a particular subject, doesn\'t mean you’re lying…it means that there is usually more to that story. To combat this, before you take the poly you will talk with the examiner and go over every question that is on the exam. That way you can address any gray areas. You may have answered a question in your background with a “no” answer, but there is a “comma, but” to it though…if you know what I mean. Make sure that you address any of these areas with the background investigator and with the polygraph examiner before taking the test. That way, you’ll feel that it’s been addressed and it is much more likely to be a non-issue. Third, please know that common sense is still very much on the table. Have you seen the scene from Ocean’s Eleven where the “smart guy” is undergoing a polygraph so he can get the casino job? They put a thumb tack in his shoe so that when he could poke his foot on the truthful answers and not on the lies. That way he was consistent through the exam. He was always stressed. The examiner even makes the comment that “man to look at him, I would swear he’s being deceptive.” Well, first…the thumb tack trick doesn\'t work…don’t try it. You’ll end up with a hurt foot, and deception everywhere. Second, the human element will be sure to include any potential signs of deception. Again, it is generally a bad idea to try and determine how to beat this test. Don’t do it, just be honest through the process. Each step is there for a reason. Finally, and most importantly, you should know that everyone is intimidated by this step in the process. You don’t need to worry about nervousness tripping the machine or giving you a false indication of deception. If it did that just because people were nervous, then no one would ever pass these tests. The poly tends to be the part of the process that everyone dreads…and that really shouldn\'t be the case. You have already answered every question during your background investigation that they are going to ask you on the polygraph. Be honest and thorough during that portion of the process and you’ll be fine. I hope this has illuminated the polygraph a bit. It’s one of the more intimidating portions of the process, I understand this. It should be the easiest part though. You\'ve already answered these questions, some of them several times. This should just be about verifying what we already know. Thank you for taking the time to read this, should you have any questions feel free to PM me. I’m also taking requests for the next edition in this series. I was leaning towards interviews, but that may require some separation as there are several formats you’ll see in this kind of a process. I\'ve also seen questions about the psychological evals before too. ','created_utc':1419352830,'title':'The Hiring Process Vol. 3 / Polygraph and Deception Detection Devices'}]

Are you referring to the slight ping in certain people's voices that give it a clarity or you talking about the slight 'oomph' in certain people's voices?\n\n  Either way, yeah i think it is a pretty decent sounding voice. You mentioned that your teacher is asking you to open the throat and i would like to know what he/she said to instruct you to open the throat. \n\n  What i am noticing is that the vowel is tending towards the 'pushed' and spread side possibly from a slight over emphasis on the opening of the throat. Here is the key, you need to both have an open/relaxed throat with a clear sound. A clear sound being a sound with clarity and focus or some would term to as 'ping'. One way you can do it is pretty simple. Simply do 2 sets of scales on the same key. The do-mi-re-fa-mi-so-fa-re-mi-do-re-ti-do(the one you do on the recording). Do it twice. First on a hum/ng sound and then on the second scale open the vowel in either an 'EE' or an 'Ah'. \n\n  Do either the hum or the 'ng'. Whichever is more comfortable for you. The 'ng' is basically a sustained 'ng' pronunciation as in the word 'sing' or 'ring'. Some also would call this an open hum. Then on the hum/ng, try to find a clear buzzing sensation in the front of your face and at the lips if you are doing a hum. Do not force the sensation, focus on simply humming and the sensation should materialize by itself. Then simply try to keep this same clarity or 'buzz' when you open the mouth into the EE/AH vowel. \n\n  You may need to record yourself while doing this. Many a times i have notice that people can produce a relatively focused and clean hum/ng. But when they open the mouth to produce a vowel, the tone quality drastically changes into something way less focused and clear. So when you record yourself, see if you can produce the cleanest most 'forward' sound on the hum/ng and see that if you open to the vowel, does the tone quality drastically change. The goal is to keep the tone quality *relatively* consistent. \n\n  Remember that you are trying to keep the same clarity and focus, different people sound different when the open the hum depending on the physiology of the vocal tract and cords. So it is more important to focus on the forward clarity so as to not make the sound overly nasal or squeezed.

The actual structure of the iss itself looks different in different nasa pictures, how is this possible? There's abundant evidence that they faked the challenger disaster. Why? There are videos where women astronauts have weird puffy hair (which shouldn't happen) in the iss when their hair doesn't act in such a way on zero gravity planes.

He did his job, but he had no oversight, but even he was aware that a 3 hr cut isnt necessarily what the studio wants.\n\nThe studio shouldve just released the UE. It probably would\'ve made less with the decrease in number of showings, but it would\'ve been a more respected film, and that carries more wait in the end. But the movie was uneven in its delivery of action sequences. It was mostly contained to the last act. Having a 2 hour set up of character building and dialogue isn\'t the best strategy when marketing to GA. They want to be entertained. WB probably saw this and wanted to get to the action much quicker, even though they wouldnt\' have had to do that had there been multiple action sequences throughout the entire film. But all we got in the first 2 hrs was the short scene of Superman in Africa, Knightmare Batman, Batmobile scene, and then the non-stop 3rd hour.\n\nThis film needed clear work from the very beginning.

To explain:\n\nRemember when Anne Burrell challenged Bobby to a cheesecake battle, and won? Anne admitted it’s not her favorite dish, but she knows that Bobby sucks at desserts. Didn\'t you think to yourself at the time, "Why hasn\'t anyone else thought to do that?" I bet they have. I bet lots of people have. But to ensure that Bobby maintains a favorable batting average (and therefore looks good/stays happy on the show), the producers ask what chefs intend to cook as their signature dish in the audition process, and then only pick challengers who either a), are going to cook something that\'s already in Bobby\'s wheelhouse (how many times have we seen *that* happen?), or b), are going to cook something unique, but it\'s an irregular (or just plain stupid) version of that unique thing. Given that when confronted with a dish unfamiliar to him, Bobby always prepares a straightforward version, Bobby\'s earnest dish will usually win out over the platter of WHUT put out by the challenger.\n\nDon’t take my word for it, just watch the show. Usually when the challenger announces their dish you think to yourself, “oh Bobby’s screwed on this one,” but then immediately they cut to that interview where a smiling, imbecilic contender says, “My version of ________ has... [some looney goddamn ingredient or technique that doesn’t belong in that dish].” And then they are oh-so-surprised at the end of the show when their inane concoction gets clobbered by Mr. Flay.\n\nBTW if you’re still doubtful, the producers HAVE to know the secret in advance. There’s no way they’re stopping production while a P.A. runs out to buy liver &amp; onions.\n\nWhich brings me back to Anne Burrell and her cheesecake. Celebrity chefs win against Bobby more often because they are who they are, and they can cook whatever they want to. The producers are just happy to have them on the show, and when Bobby loses to them it doesn\'t look as bad.\n\nThis also illuminates why we so often see judges who themselves have a background in whatever the signature dish is. If the producers know what the challenger is going to cook, they can bring in judges who know how it\'s supposed to be cooked (and also importantly, know that it\'s not supposed to be cooked in whatever godforsaken manner than the challenger plans).\n\nOne final thing: Though I’m inclined to believe that Bobby doesn’t actually know what the signature dish will be (even though the producers do), I wouldn’t be too terribly surprised if one of his assistants or sous-chefs has been told the dish and has “seeded” Bobby’s pantry with ideas. I’m sure it’s always well-stocked, but c’mon... it can’t hold more than a fraction of what’s in the supermarket. So when Bobby looks and sees a bottle of, say, pomegranate molasses that’s not normally there, that’s his clue. “Oh yeah, a gastrique would work really well here.”\n\nThis might seem a bit shady, but it doesn’t conflict directly with anything the show tells you about how it works.

Most people want their gender assumed off appearance or else don’t care; it’s only a very few whose appearance doesn’t match gender, or identify as a non-binary gender.\n\nSociety already accommodates situations like this. We provide wheelchair ramps, nut-free foods, and gender neutral bathrooms on top of the stairs, PB&amp;J, and gendered bathrooms that most people use. You might have to ask someone or travel a bit more to be accommodated, but society has deemed this small extra effort acceptable, because very few people need to be accommodated. It’s thus reasonable to expect the individual to request certain pronouns if it’s important to them.\n\nSociety recognizes disabilities, allergies, and even hard to pronounce names as legitimate. The root issue is that non-conforming genders aren’t always recognized as legitimate, and harassment of the group occurs. No one says to a person who says they have an allergy “Really? You don’t look like you have an allergy?” We all need to be educated and tolerant towards other pronouns and genders, and not tolerate harassment of this group. Basically, recognize your assumptions aren’t always correct, and be gracious if you’re wrong.\n\nIt’s a waste of time and effort to make everyone ask or introduce pronouns or gender, because most people don’t care. You should feel free to do this if you want to, but otherwise, you have to live with reasonable assumptions. This solution is much more practical, and much more likely to be implemented and accepted by everyone.\n\nIn essence, make an assumption, if you find out otherwise, go with it. This isn’t difficult or a big deal. As far as ethics and economics are concerned, this solution is the best one.\n\nCMV, I’d be glad to discuss parts of the solution you take issue with in more detail', 'from_id': None}]
e5mg3s7	[{'id':'e5mg3s7','body':'I generally agree with this, but it is context sensitive. If you are at a venue where you are asked to introduce yourself and your pronouns, it is churlish to refuse to do so, AND in that context it’s best to ask rather that assume. Since that kind of venue is fairly rare, it is not an unusual burden to ‘go with the flow’. I organize events professionally, and have never included as part of introductions. The number of people who are uncomfortable with the practice exceeds the number of people who prefer asking. In issues of human decency ‘majority rules’ is not the rule of thumb.

9eci2u	[{'id':'9eci2u','selftext':'This is pieced together from random bits from both movies 1. Monsters, Inc. is the only company ever mentioned in relation to the energy crisis. No one else is stepping up to help solve what should be a civilization-impacting problem. Is it more likely that they are supplying power to only one city, or to an entire world? This is further underlined when dialogue from the second movie only ever refers to Monsters, Inc as the destination for those who want to be scarers (which incidentally, only seem to come from two schools, both of which are also apparently in the city). Also, it is interesting to note that Boo going through the door into the Monster World was said to be "the first time in Monster History", and if there were other companies using Door Tech, you would think this would have happened before and there would be protocols for it. 2. The All-Time Scare Record covers only Monsters, Inc, with no indication that there is anyone else at any other companies to compete with. 3. Waternoose mentions that the company has been in his family for "3 generations" (Alluding to a possible timeline for energy research in the Monster World, but that\'s a whole other theory), and he seems unusually attached to it. Most rich people would take advantage of other options and be unconcerned about 1 company. but something in the way he says it (especially since he is not the sole owner, given his concern about the Board of Directors) suggests that there simply are no other options for him. Why wouldn\'t there be other options for him in a decent-sized world? 4. Monstropolis is the only city ever mentioned. No indication that the supposedly-massive energy crisis is causing problems anywhere else, like in other, less-wealthy countries 5. When trying to get rid of Boo, Mike makes several interesting statements: 1. He refers to digging a tunnel under the city 2. Using these to release Boo into "The Wild" 3. And he has previously discarded ideas involving an enormous slingshot and a gigantic wooden horse 6. Why would tunnels be necessary? Why all the planning in the first place? Why not just stuff Boo in the trunk of his car, drive her out of city limits, and set her loose? Because he can\'t. And what are all these things good at doing? Getting past walls. And walls, especially ones you can\'t get past, are usually there for a reason. But what reason? We\'ve seen gigantic monsters in both movies, so the most likely reason seems to be that there are things out there that put even these kaiju to shame, or else they could simply march outside and kill whatever is threatening Monster civilization. But even this presents a problem, because then the Monsters could still periodically leave the city like Attack on Titan. Yet Mike\'s apparent refusal to consider going through any possible gates aside from an ridiculously overkill idea suggests that if any gates do exist, they are tightly sealed against all but the most extreme of circumstances. Why would they be sealed if the Monsters could leave? The simplest explanation for this is that the very environment is hostile to the Monsters. What kind of environment could "The Wild" be? A never-ending wasteland like the Glowing Sea? A land that has already mutated some lifeforms into Lovecraftian horrors that stalk the land looking for lesser life to consume? Could this land be related to some event that caused Monster civilization to reject other forms of energy in favor of relatively safe, non-volatile scream energy? &#x200B; &#x200B;','created_utc':1536494917,'title':'[Monsters Inc] Monstropolis is the only city in a destroyed world'}]

3im341	[{'id':'3im341','selftext':'Last night, my wife\'s boss from her brand new job invited us over for dinner. On the drive over, my wife reiterated many times to me just how important it was to make a good impression. I scoffed and arrogantly informed my silly wife that I always make good impressions. My wife\'s boss is a single lady in her fifties, so it was just the three of us. We chitchatted over drinks and salads and seemed to really be hitting it off. She laughed at my well-timed, perfectly-appropriate jokes and my wife seemed pleased. Soon she brought out the main course, a nice big juicy steak for each of us. As I began to cut into my steak, I was discouraged to discover how under cooked this steak was. Now, I\'ve had my fair share of rare steak. I prefer medium, but I can handle rare. This was several-minutes-on-a-hot-grill short of rare. I probably could\'ve resuscitated the cow had I tried. Instead, I sat there fidgeting with my knife and fork, worrying about how I was going to get away with not eating this steak. Claim vegan-ism? No, I\'d already feigned great enthusiasm upon seeing the steak. Just then, our hostess excused herself to the kitchen to take care of some dessert preparations. As I looked across the fancy dining room table at the open window of this 3rd story apartment... a cartoon light bulb appeared over my head. I knew I had to be decisive, realizing that she could return at any moment. I committed. I grabbed the steak with my hand, gently shook off the juice and executed a perfect throw right through the center of the open window. Here\'s the big time FU. The window wasn\'t open. It was the cleanest fricking window you\'ve ever seen in your life. That is, until my mostly raw slab of steak slammed up against it and slowly slid down leaving a trail of bloody juice in its wake. My wife - who\'s steak was a nice medium rare and was unaware of my predicament - turned, jaw dropped, and stared at me like I was an alien from another planet. This look then slowly morphed into more of a there-is-no-place-on-this-planet-you-can-ever-hide-from-me expression of demonic anger. My wife\'s boss heard the thud of the steak-on-window impact and came quickly. She took in the scene, the steak sitting on the window sill, the blood trail, my empty plate, and then gave me an inquisitive, puzzled look. I just didn\'t know what to say. It felt like a minute of silence, but was probably 3 or 4 seconds. Finally, the best I could manage was "I... I\'m so sorry. I am such a clutz... I don\'t know... I was just cutting it.. and... it... ... it slipped... just ask my wife, I really am a clutz... right honey?... (no help coming from that direction) ... I will clean this up... I can\'t believe this... I am so sorry" etc... etc... Both women continued to stare at me like I had escaped from the loony bin, as I smeared the blood around the window with my cloth napkin, dusted off the steak, and continued to mutter my incoherent explanation. I knew no one was buying the story. I knew what I had to do. I sheepishly returned to my seat and proceeded to eat every bite of that disgusting, cold, chewy, bloody, raw steak. I remained pretty quiet the rest of the evening. My wife\'s only two words to me since the incident are "I\'m fine". TL;DR: Tried to sneakily throw my under-cooked steak through an open window... only to find out it wasn\'t open. Edit: Thanks kind redditors (: Update: Just got the first post-"I\'m fine" communication from my wife, via text, who is at work...

Slavery is widely known , so is the KKK (albeit superficially) , but I\'m quite sure most people have no idea what Jim Crow laws are, or that official segregation continued into the 1960s, and most other race-related history. It definitely looks to me like American society as a whole isn\'t doing a good job of moving past these issues, and that the racial division is even encouraged at some level, but I am not as presumption as to preach solutions, having never lived in the US, let alone as a racial minority. I find it annoying when Americans try to apply US racial concepts to Europe, and thus make absurd statements, so it\'s only fair for me to admit my limited understanding of the subject, even if I consider myself to know US history better than 90% of Europeans.','created_utc':1568056597}]
